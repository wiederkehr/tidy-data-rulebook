{"name":"Tidy Data Rulebook","tagline":"This is a list of best practices and a compilation of the most common mistakes when we collect, store, and deliver data for further analysis and visualization. Itâ€™s inspired and broadly based on the excellent paper Tidy Data (http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10) by Hadley Wickham as well as our own experience at Interactive Things while working with clients on data-driven design projects.","body":"## Data Structure Best Practices\r\n- Each variable forms a column.\r\n- Each observation forms a row.\r\n- Each type of observational unit forms a table.\r\n\r\n## Common Data Structure Defects\r\n- Column headers are values, not variable names.\r\n- Multiple variables are stored in one column.\r\n- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\r\n- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\r\n- A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\r\n\r\n## Spreadsheet Best Practices\r\n- Format data standardized and consistent (like dates and currencies).\r\n- Keep table headers standardized and consistent (lowercase, underscored).\r\n- Keep file names standardized and consistent.\r\n- Deliver your spreadsheets as CSV files instead of XLS files.\r\n- Deliver your spreadsheets as UTF-8 formatted.\r\n\r\n## Common Spreadsheet Defects\r\n- Introductory and other unnecessary text.\r\n- Missing column header.\r\n- Multiple column header lines.\r\n- Comments in columns where values should be.\r\n- Formatting on text and background of cells.\r\n- Empty columns and rows for layout purposes.\r\n- Connected cells between spreadsheets.\r\n- Formulas to transform values in cells.\r\n- Auto-formatting of values in cells (like dates and currencies).\r\n- Hidden columns (either show them when necessary or delete them).\r\n- Multiple tables on one spreadsheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n- http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf\r\n- http://kb.tableau.com/articles/knowledgebase/preparing-excel-files-analysis\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
